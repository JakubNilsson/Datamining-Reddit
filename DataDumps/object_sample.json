// Representation of object types
t1_: comment
t2_: account
t3_: link
t4_: message
t5_: subreddit

/* 
	All objects within the dataset are either comments or links. They can contain
 	references to parent nodes if they are not the root node themselves. 
	
	A parent node can be either a link (root) or a comment, ie, if one replies to a comment,
	then that comment is the parent node.

	If a parent node of an object is of type link (t3), then it means that it is a reply to the root node.
	If a parent node is of type comment (t1), then it means that it is a reply to a comment B which in turn is a reply to
	link A (root).
	
	If the name of an object is of type t3 then it means that it is the root.
 	Regardless of whether an object is a comment or not, it can still be linked to, and so
 	they all have a link_id, which is of type link (t3_xxxx).

 	id refers to the id of an object itself, id == name and they are of type t1 (comment). Links are treated as comments
 	which it is this way. All objects are comments and then a link inherits the properties of a comment.
